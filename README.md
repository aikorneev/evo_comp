# Evolutionary Computing
Solutions for problems from Evolutionary Computing university course. DEAP framework is used for building genetic algorithms.

+ **EC_rastrigin** - Building an evolutionary algorithm to find an optimum of Rastrigin function for 100 dimensions. 
+ **EC_ReinforcementLearning** - Learning the RI agent to play [GYM](https://gym.openai.com/) environment "LunarLander-v2". The agent is a neural nerwork, which parameters can be found by genetic algorithm. 
+ **EC_salesman** - Travelling salesman problem solution. The aim is to find a shortest path through 131 cities (2D coordinates). Limitations: distance < 800 (the best one is 564), generations num <= 2000, species < 50. [Dataset] (http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/vlsi/index.html) - XQF 131 problem.
